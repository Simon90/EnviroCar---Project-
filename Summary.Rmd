R is a open-source software for general data analysis. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of platforms and provides a big sample of statistical and graphical methods. Furthermore, R is easily extendable through a massive amount of so-called packages. Currently, there are round about 6000 packages available on the "Comprehensive R Archive Network", short called CRAN. The number of developers and published packages are growing continuously. However, each package has got help pages, several documentations and useful example code chunks. (R-Project, 2014)
